# Common Circuits Keychain

Did you visit common circuits in Atlanta? And did you perhaps find yourself with a commemmorative keychain accessory circuit board? After admiring the that commemoraive keychain accessory circuit board for it's thoughtfulness, uniqueness, and clearly creative designer  - did you find yourself in a state of confounded intruige as to the potential operation of the CKACB (commemmorative keychain accessory circuit board)? Well you may be alone. Not that you are weird or slow or anyitng. It's just that I only made a few of these things...and I assume most people find them to be such a fashionable accessory, they may not even stop to think about the wonders that lie within the traces of their flashy keychain...but not you, you curious fellow. 

## What Dis Do?

All shall be revealed in due time...   

And that time is now. It's a synth. I mean it was pretty obvious to be honest..if you think about it. It's not like the event was for farming equipment or something. Then it maybe I could let it slide that you thought this was some sort of sprinkler timer. Or a controller to a door that automatically opens at sunrise to let the chickens out. The event was like 90% music oriented. So you clearly already knew this. You are smart. Smaart and Kind. And are just patiently waiting for the instructions on how do make it do a thing. The thing you knew it could do all along. Deep in your heart. And for that, I applaud you. And wait shall you no more!

## Stepped Tone Generator / Atari Punk Console

This circuit is based off Forest Mims III Stepped Tone Generator circuit. It generates 8-bit console sounds from high pitched zippng lasers to gravelly distorted bass. It's great. I hope you like it.
